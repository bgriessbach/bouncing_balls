## Usage Instructions
The package has a build bundle in the /dist folder. You can use for example http-server(https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to run the bundle directly.   

If you want to run the unbundled code, please run npm install first in the root directory to install all dependencies. Then you can run npm start.

## Description

This website uses Angular 5 and TypeScript. Polyfills were added to allow cross-functionality in IE 11. The performance was tested in latest Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge and IE11 browsers. I currently don't own a Mac, so I could not test Safari.
